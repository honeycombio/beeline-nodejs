# Honeycomb Beeline for NodeJS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/honeycombio/beeline-nodejs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/honeycombio/beeline-nodejs)

This package instruments your Express/NodeJS application for use with [Honeycomb](https://honeycomb.io). Slice and dice requests by endpoint, status, or even User ID, with zero custom instrumentation required([1](#footnotes)).

Requires Node 8+. Sign up for a [Honeycomb trial](https://ui.honeycomb.io/signup) to obtain a Write Key before starting.

# Installation (Quick)

If you've got a NodeJS `express` app, you can get request-level instrumentation of Express and other packages you use, magically.

Start by installing this package:

```bash
npm install --save honeycomb-beeline
```

And adding this to the top of your `app.js` **before** `require`/`import`ing of other packages:

```javascript
require("honeycomb-beeline")({
  writeKey: "YOUR-WRITE-KEY",
  /* ... additional optional configuration ... */
});
```

# Configuration

The `optional configuration` above allows configuring global settings (Honeycomb credentials and dataset name) as well as per-instrumentation settings:

```javascript
{
    writeKey: "/* your honeycomb write key, required */",
    dataset: "/* the name of the dataset you want to use (defaults to "nodejs") */"
    $instrumentationName: {
        /* instrumentation specific settings */
    }
}
```

Both `writeKey` and `dataset` can also be supplied in the environment, by setting `HONEYCOMB_WRITEKEY` and `HONEYCOMB_DATASET`, respectively.

For instrumentation settings, use the name of the instrumentation. For example, to add configuration options for `express`, your config object might look like:

```javascript
{
    writeKey: "1234567890asbcdef",
    dataset: "my-express-server",
    express: {
        /* express-specific settings */
    }
}
```

For available configuration options per instrumentation, see the Instrumented packages section below.

# Example questions

* Which of my express app's endpoints are the slowest?

```
BREAKDOWN: request.url
CALCULATE: P99(duration_ms)
FILTER: meta.type == express
ORDER BY: P99(duration_ms) DESC
```

* Where's my app doing the most work / spending the most time?

```
BREAKDOWN: meta.type
CALCULATE: P99(duration_ms)
ORDER BY: P99(duration_ms) DESC
```

* Which users are using the endpoint that I'd like to deprecate?

```
BREAKDOWN: request.user.email
CALCULATE: COUNT
FILTER: request.url == <endpoint-url>
```

* Which XHR endpoints take the longest?

```
BREAKDOWN: request.url
CALCULATE: P99(duration_ms)
FILTER: meta.type == express AND request.xhr == true
ORDER BY: P99(duration_ms) DESC
```

# Instrumented packages

The following is a list of packages we've added instrumentation for. Some actually add context to events, while others are only instrumented to enable
context propagation (mostly the `Promise`-like packages.)

## bluebird

Instrumented only for context propagation

## express

Adds columns with prefix `request.`

### Configuration options

| Name                  | Type                                                     |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `express.userContext` | Array&lt;string&gt;\|Function&lt;(request) => Object&gt; |

#### `express.userContext`

If the value of this option is an array, it's assumed to be an array of string field names of `req.user`. If a request has `req.user`, the named fields are extracted and added to events with column names of `express.user.$fieldName`.

For example:

If `req.user` is an object `{ id: 1, username: "toshok" }` and your config settings include `express: { userContext: ["username"] }`, the following will be included in the express event sent to honeycomb:

| `request.user.username` |
| :---------------------- |
| `toshok`                |

If the value of this option is a function, it will be called on every request and passed the request as the sole argument. All key-values in the returned object will be added to the event. If the function returns a falsey value, no columns will be added. To replicate the above Array-based behavior, you could use the following config: `express: { userContext: (req) => req.user && { username: req.user.username } }`

This function isn't limited to using the request object, and can pull info from anywhere to enrich the data sent about the user.

## http

Adds columns with prefix `http.`

## https

Adds columns with prefix `https.`

## mongoose

Instrumented only for context propagation

## mongodb

Adds columns with prefix `db.`

### Configuration options

| Name                       | Type    |
| -------------------------- | ------- |
| `mongodb.includeDocuments` | boolean |

#### `mongodb.includeDocuments`

If true, documents in the api will be JSON serialized and included in the events sent to honeycomb.

## mpromise

Instrumented only for context propagation

## mysql2

Adds columns with prefix `db.`

## react-dom/server

Adds columns with prefix `react.`

## sequelize

Instrumented only for context propagation

# Adding additional context

See [docs/CustomContext.md](https://github.com/honeycombio/beeline-nodejs/blob/master/docs/CustomContext.md)

# Troubleshooting

Use the `DEBUG=honeycomb-beeline:*` environment variable to produce debug output.

1.  For the currently limited set of supported packages, and only until you realize how powerful added custom instrumentation can make things :)
