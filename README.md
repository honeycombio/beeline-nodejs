This package makes it easy to instrument your Express/NodeJS application to send useful events to [Honeycomb](https://honeycomb.io), a service for debugging your software in production.

- [Usage and Examples](https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-data-in/beelines/nodejs-beeline/)
- [API Reference](docs/API.md)

## Dependencies

- **Node 10+**

## Known Issues

- Using a bundler (esbuild, webpack, etc.) or ESM with the Beeline is unsupported. You may be able to use the Beeline in those cases, but auto-instrumentations will likely not work.

## Running postgresql tests locally

If you don't have postgresql running locally, you can launch postgresql in docker.

```
docker run -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=root circleci/postgres:9-alpine-ram
```

Then run the tests using

```
PGUSER=root PGDATABASE=postgres npm test
```
